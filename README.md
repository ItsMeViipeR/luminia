# What is Luminia?

Luminia is a simple programming language I am creating to learn and practice [Dart](https://dart.dev).

# How to use Luminia?

**Luminia** is experimental and have 3 basics features:

1. Variables definitions
2. Functions definitions
3. Integrated print function to print variable and content

**Luminia** cannot be installed yet but you can use it while following these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.lu` file
3. Put your code in this file
4. Go to bin/Luminia.dart and edit `"examples/test.tl"` with the path to yout `.tl` file
5. Execute `dart run` and enjoy

# How to code with Luminia?

**Luminia**'s syntax has been inspired by [Python](https://python.org), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

This code is a **Testcode** code example:

```lu
fn main(): void {
    print("Hello World!");
}
```

This is a simple Hello World so the ouput should be `Hello World!`. If this is not, remember that the language is in development and can be broken at every time.

Remember that you can find examples in the `examples` folder.
